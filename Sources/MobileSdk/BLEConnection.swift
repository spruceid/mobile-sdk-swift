        // we could build a framing protocol on top, or we could use the State characteristics to signal out
        // of band, but neither of those are specified by the spec, so we'd be out of compliance.  The State
        // signalling is what the non-L2CAP flow uses, but the spec explicitly says it's not used with L2CAP.
        //
        //    Another thing we could do would be close the connection, but there are two problems with that;
        // the first is we'd be out of spec compliance again, and the second is that we actually have two
        // messages going, one in each direction, serially.  If we closed to indicate the length of the first,
        // we'd have no connection for the second.
        //
        //    So, we have data coming in, and we don't know how much.  The stream lets us know when more data
        // has arrived, the data comes in chunks.  What we do, then, is timestamp when we receive some data,
        // and then half a second later see if we got any more.  Hopefully the half second delay is small
        // enough not to annoy the user and large enough to account for noisy radio environments, but the
